## 题目描述

There is an `m x n` rectangular island that borders both the **Pacific Ocean** and **Atlantic Ocean**. The **Pacific Ocean** touches the island's left and top edges, and the **Atlantic Ocean** touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the **height above sea level** of the cell at coordinate `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is **less than or equal to** the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return *a **2D list** of grid coordinates* `result` *where* `result[i] = [ri, ci]` *denotes that rain water can flow from cell* `(ri, ci)` *to **both** the Pacific and Atlantic oceans*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
Explanation: The following cells can flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as shown below:
[0,4]: [0,4] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [0,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,3]: [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,3] -> [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[1,4]: [1,4] -> [1,3] -> [0,3] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [1,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[2,2]: [2,2] -> [1,2] -> [0,2] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [2,2] -> [2,3] -> [2,4] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,0]: [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,0] -> [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
[3,1]: [3,1] -> [3,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [3,1] -> [4,1] -> Atlantic Ocean
[4,0]: [4,0] -> Pacific Ocean 
       [4,0] -> Atlantic Ocean
Note that there are other possible paths for these cells to flow to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [[1]]
Output: [[0,0]]
Explanation: The water can flow from the only cell to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == heights.length`
- `n == heights[r].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= heights[r][c] <= 105`

#### Pyhton3

```python
class Solution:
    def pacificAtlantic(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        pacific_visited = set()
        atlantic_visited = set()
        rows = len(heights)
        cols = len(heights[0])

        def dfs(r, c, visited, prev_height):
            if ((r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r == rows or c < 0 or c == cols or heights[r][c] < prev_height):
                return
            visited.add((r, c))
            dfs(r - 1, c, visited, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r + 1, c, visited, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r, c - 1, visited, heights[r][c])
            dfs(r, c + 1, visited, heights[r][c])

        for col in range (cols):
            # Pacific
            dfs(0, col, pacific_visited, heights[0][col])
            # Atlatntic
            dfs(rows - 1, col, atlantic_visited, heights[rows - 1][col])
        
        for row in range (rows):
            # Pacific
            dfs(row, 0, pacific_visited, heights[row][0])
            # Atlatntic
            dfs(row, cols - 1, atlantic_visited, heights[row][cols - 1])
        
        return list(pacific_visited.intersection(atlantic_visited))
```
