## 题目描述

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## 解法

#### Pyhton3

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # 2D array 通常可以用 DFS 或 BFS 去解
        def dfs(grid, i, j):
            if not 0 <= i < len(grid) or not 0 <= j < len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] == '0':
                return
            grid[i][j] = '0'
            dfs(grid, i + 1, j)
            dfs(grid, i - 1, j)
            dfs(grid, i, j - 1)
            dfs(grid, i, j + 1)
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    dfs(grid, i, j)
                    count += 1
        return count
```
