## 题目描述

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window*** 

***substring\***

 *of* `s` *such that every character in* `t` *(**including duplicates**) is included in the window*. If there is no such substring, return *the empty string* `""`.



The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

 

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

#### Pyhton3

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        lookup = collections.Counter(t)
        match = 0
        start = 0
        min_window_substring = ""
        min_window_size = float('inf')

        for end in range (len(s)):
            if s[end] in lookup:
                lookup[s[end]] -= 1
                if lookup[s[end]] == 0:
                    match += 1
            
            while match == len(lookup) and start < end + 1:
                curr_win_size = end - start + 1
                if curr_win_size < min_window_size:
                    min_window_size = curr_win_size
                    min_window_substring = s[start: end+1]
                
                if s[start] in lookup:
                    if lookup[s[start]] == 0:
                        match -= 1
                    lookup[s[start]] += 1
                start += 1
        return min_window_substring if min_window_substring else ""
