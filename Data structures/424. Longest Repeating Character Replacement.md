## 题目描述

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return *the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
- `0 <= k <= s.length`

## 解法

#### Pyhton3

```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        lookup = {}
        start = 0 
        # 用滑动窗口解题
        for end in range (len(s)):
            lookup[s[end]] = lookup.get(s[end], 0) + 1
            length = end - start + 1

            if length - max(lookup.values()) > k:
                lookup[s[start]] -= 1
                start += 1
        return end - start + 1 
```
